        This is just a quickly put together overview of what the final product of my project looked like.

        This is what the project looked like. It's not that pretty looking, but I'm not actually selling this thing 
        or anything. The hardware consists of the AVR-BLE, a speaker, three buttons, a potentiometer dial, and an 
        OLED display.
