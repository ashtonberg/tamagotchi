# tamagotchi

This is my final prject for CSCI 5143, Real-Time and Embedded Systems, Spring 2024.

For my project, I created a simpler version of a Tamagotchi, which is a digital pet on a keychain. 

[Here]{https://ashtonberg.github.io/tamagotchi/} is a very quickly thrown together GitHub Pages website with a description of the final product and some videos.
Also check out the "5143 Final Report.pdf" file for a more in depth explanation of how everything actually works and some more pictures of the project.
